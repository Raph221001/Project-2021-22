# Description of Project

The goal of this project was to create a procedurally generated terrain with procedural trees. The player would have the ability to walk and jump around the the terrain while listening to the calm music that would be playing as the project is running. The leaves on the trees also move as if there is wind blowing them from side to side. The idea behind all of this was to fully enhance the user experience while they are walking throgh the procedural world. There is also a day and night cycle feature which makes seem like the player has been exploring this world for days.

# Instructions for use

You should first press the play button in Unity to start the project. Once the project has started running the player drop on the terrain where they have a great experience ahead of them. The WASD keys can be used to control the player as well as the arrow keys. Your mouse or touchpad can be used to look around and move in whatever direction you want. If you want to jump the spacebar button may be pressed to achieve this.

# How it Works

## Procedural Terrain

An infinite terrain is generated here using the perlin noise function. As the player walks closer to the edge of the map more terrain is generated and this cycle will continue forever.

## Procedural Trees

Trees were created by using the Unity GameObject. They all have a capsule collidor which prevents the player from walking through them and allows them to collide with the trees. The trees also have a wind zone which can give the player the impression that there is actual wind blowing and therfore causing the movement of the leaves on the trees.

The goal of this assignment is to create an impressive system in Unity that uses procedural generation, 3D models and paints a picture in code. I would like to create an infinite terrain with procedural trees for this terrain. I would also like to have other procedural objects on the terrain that can really enhance the user experience while going through the terrain. There would most likely be clouds that would be created for the sky as well.
