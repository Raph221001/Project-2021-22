The goal of this assignment is to create an impressive system in Unity that uses procedural generation, 3D models and paints a picture in code. I would like to create an infinite terrain with procedural trees for this terrain. I would also like to have other procedural objects on the terrain that can really enhance the user experience while going through the terrain. There would most likely be clouds that would be created for the sky as well.
