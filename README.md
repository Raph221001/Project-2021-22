# Description of Project

The goal of this project was to create a procedurally generated terrain with procedural trees. The player would have the ability to walk and jump around the the terrain while listening to the calm music that would be playing as the project is running. The leaves on the trees also move as if there is wind blowing them from side to side. The idea behind all of this was to fully enhance the user experience while they are walking throgh the procedural world. There is also a day and night cycle feature which makes seem like the player has been exploring this world for days.

The goal of this assignment is to create an impressive system in Unity that uses procedural generation, 3D models and paints a picture in code. I would like to create an infinite terrain with procedural trees for this terrain. I would also like to have other procedural objects on the terrain that can really enhance the user experience while going through the terrain. There would most likely be clouds that would be created for the sky as well.
