The goal of this assignment is to create an impressive system in Unity that uses procedural generation, 3D models and paints a picture in code. I have decided to create an audio visualizer that will generate animated imagery based on music. I would like to procedurally build the environment in response to the music that is playing. I want to create visuals that will basically relate to the music and so therefore make the  listening experience alot more enjoyable. I am thinking of creating a mesh terrain that would
react to the different sounds of the music. There would be changes of colour and different animations of  objects based on the music.  I would also hope to create different procedural animations for potential objects in the viusalizer giving the user a more enhancing experience when listening to music.
